His team lead JC and crew appeared on the day promised early and immediate started work. They had a \'documented\' plan on what was to be done. They arrived each day early and worked diligently through the day. The project included several dry creek beds of river rock. They dug, shaped, and designed the creek beds and beautifully arranged the rock. It was strenuous work but they never slowed down and the project was completed on time. We did ask for a minor change and it was accommodated. There was considerable \'clean up\' of our landscape due to construction.

The first day, they were meticulous in the way they prepared our yard for its new design. The second day, they installed the sod first, then the plants and finally the mulch. In a few instances, we were consulted about placement and came to decisions together. Then they watered the sod and every single plant. They blew everything including our front and back decks so it looked amazing. We have a parking spot which always flooded after a rain. Michael said to just lower the surrounding landscaping.

In an industry that can be easily commoditized, where any person with a truck and shovel can call themselves a \"professional landscaper\", I realized long ago that what price will not be the definitive difference between Michaelangelo\'s and the next company. Over the years, I have found from speaking with my clients that quality, communication, and customer service were what they valued the most. Our focus at Michaelangelo\'s has been to provide the best customer service and the highest levels of communication in the industry. We have never been the lowest price, but we are the best VALUE. In particular with your project, we worked with your wife directly to review each and every plant that was delivered and installed on your property. She worked with our on-site manager to handpick all of her plants. We even rejected some plants she did not like and made a special trip to several nurseries to find the right fit. All of that is part of the outstanding service we provide. As many of our testimonials will show, we are the best overall VALUE in the industry. If you want the best customer experience and the best overall quality in the Atlanta market, choose Michaelangelo\'s.

As part of that change, it was necessary to replace a substantial portion of our lawn. The new sections of the lawn have been put down to our total satisfaction. We give the highest possible thanks to Justin and the rest of the crew involved in this project. They were most helpful with their ideas and patient with us throughout this process. In addition to the outcome of this project, we would like to give positive recognition to the maintenance crew that does our weekly work. They do it right. Changing to the Michaelangelo\'s Group has been one of our best decisions in 2021. We look forward to a long lasting relationship with them.","likes":1,"response":{"date":"8 months ago","snippet":"Joann, we appreciate the compliment!"}},{"user":{"name":"Felicia McCall","link":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/105775341213997625171?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj9kbnfxrj3AhVRrmoFHfPBDr8QvvQBegQIARBQ","thumbnail":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GhsuRoln32-C34g_k4BkfExQUjrwgYW34wYEeVugAw=s40-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","reviews":4,"photos":2},"rating":5,"date":"3 months ago","summary":"Positive: Professionalism, Punctuality, Quality, Responsiveness, Value","snippet":"Positive: Professionalism, Punctuality, Quality, Responsiveness, ValuePancho quickly identified my issue and turned my lawn around in just a few weeks.

They fixed this, regraded the soil, and installed new sod for our entire yard. Several days later, we had an hours-long downpour and no puddles or mud. It\'s actually hard to believe that our yard has no issues after all that rain. Concrete Ext. & Garden Box We had concrete extended on our back porch. They also built a terraced garden box with gardening soil. It\'s my favorite part of the yard. It\'s well-constructed and just a beautiful addition to our lawn. These guys do phenomenal work. I just can\'t get over how good it looks. I couldn\'t have done this myself nor could anyone on the cheap. It took professionals who knew what they\'re doing and worked as a team to produce these results . It probably helps that Michael is a landscape architect who oversees every job, not everyone is a landscape architect. They are more expensive but you get your money\'s worth and their work is guaranteed for a year. Looking back, I still would not have gone with any of the cheaper alternatives. I don\'t have a lot of money but I also don\'t have the time, patience, or money to deal with work that isn\'t done quite right and dealing with all that. If you want to take the risk and pay less for someone else, you can do that. But if you want value, what you get for what you pay for, and guaranteed to be done right, Michaelangelo\'s is who you\'ll want for this work.","likes":1,"response":{"date":"a year ago","snippet":"Thanks Joe!"}},{"user":{"name":"Jed Coxon","link":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/107508298213659925907?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj9kbnfxrj3AhVRrmoFHfPBDr8QvvQBegUIARCNAQ","thumbnail":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJz4gAPnwJ0dF6Rua_wR8F9YLnonq3qCm0FnNBRw=s40-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100","local_guide":true,"reviews":98},"rating":5,"date":"a year ago","summary":"Positive: Professionalism, Punctuality, Responsiveness","snippet":"Positive: Professionalism, Punctuality, ResponsivenessFantastic experience and loved the end result.
